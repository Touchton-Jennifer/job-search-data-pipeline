## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ with required libraries
- Power BI Desktop (free) *(dashboard development in progress)*
- **Gmail export only** (other email platforms not yet tested)

### Technical Background
This project was developed collaboratively with Claude AI, demonstrating effective AI-assisted development methodology. While I brought SQL, HTML, and Excel formula experience to the project, the Python implementation leverages AI assistance for rapid prototyping and development.

### Setup
1. **Clone/Download** project files
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install pandas spacy nltk python-dateutil`
3. **Download language model:** `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
4. **Export Gmail data** using Google Takeout (.mbox format) to `raw_data/`
5. **Run extraction pipeline:** `python comprehensive_cleanup1.py`
6. **Import to Power BI:** Use generated file from `processed_data/` *(dashboard templates coming soon)*

### Expected Runtime
- **Email extraction:** <1 minute for 1,500+ emails
- **Data cleaning:** 2-3 minutes
- **Total time investment:** ~3 hours from export to clean data (including learning curve and iterations)
- **Power BI development:** *(in progress)*
