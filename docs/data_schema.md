## üéØ Priority Scoring Algorithm

### Scoring Components
| Component | Weight | Score Range | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Status Impact** | 40% | -50 to +50 | Interview scheduled = +40, Rejected = -50 |
| **Recency** | 25% | -20 to +20 | Recent activity = +20, Old activity = -20 |
| **Confidence** | 15% | -10 to +15 | High confidence = +15, Low confidence = -10 |
| **Engagement** | 10% | 0 to +15 | Multiple emails = +15, Single email = +5 |
| **Data Quality** | 10% | 0 to +10 | Clean data = +10, Missing data = 0 |

### Calculation Formula
```
Priority Score = Base Score (50) + Status Impact + Recency + Confidence + Engagement + Data Quality
Bounded between 0 and 100
```

## üîç Data Quality Standards

### Confidence Score Thresholds
| Confidence Level | Score Range | Action Required |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| High Confidence | 80-100 | Use as-is |
| Medium Confidence | 60-79 | Monitor for accuracy |
| Low Confidence | 40-59 | Flag for review |
| Very Low Confidence | 0-39 | Require manual validation |

### Review Flag Triggers
- Company confidence < 60
- Role confidence < 60  
- Status confidence < 60
- Missing critical fields (company_name, email_date)
- Suspicious patterns (HTML artifacts, user name as company)

## üîÑ Data Lineage & Processing History

### AI-Assisted Development Notes
This schema was developed through iterative collaboration with Claude AI, demonstrating:
- **Rapid prototyping** of data structures
- **Business logic validation** through real-world testing
- **Quality improvement** through systematic iteration
- **Documentation standards** for knowledge transfer

### Processing History Tracking
Each record maintains:
- **Original extraction timestamp**
- **Cleanup version applied** (comprehensive_cleanup1.py)
- **Manual override indicators**
- **Confidence score evolution**

### Audit Trail
- All major field changes logged
- Algorithm improvements tracked via version control
- Manual corrections documented
- Data quality metrics preserved across iterations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Gmail format:** Schema optimized for Gmail .mbox structure
- **English language:** Text processing assumes English email content
- **Date formats:** Various email date formats normalized to ISO standard
- **Time zones:** Converted to local timezone for consistency

### Future Schema Enhancements
- **Multi-language support** for international job searches
- **Additional email platforms** (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Enhanced metadata** for tracking manual interventions
- **Integration fields** for external data sources (LinkedIn, Calendar)
