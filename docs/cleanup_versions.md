### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Fixed major data quality issue where 105 emails from Greenhouse ATS platform were incorrectly classified as company "Us" due to domain extraction error.

### ðŸ”§ Key Improvements
- **ATS platform recognition:** Identify emails from `us.greenhouse-mail.io`
- **Content-based extraction:** Parse real company names from email subjects and bodies
- **Pattern matching:** "Thank you for applying to [COMPANY]" and similar formats
- **Confidence scoring:** Assign appropriate confidence levels to extracted companies

### ðŸ“Š Results Achieved
- **Before:** 105 records incorrectly labeled as company "Us"
- **After:** 50+ real companies extracted (ClickUp, Gladly, Vonage, Lyft, etc.)
- **Accuracy improvement:** 105 â†’ 55 unknown companies (-48% unknown rate)
- **Quality improvement:** Achieved ~75% accurate company identification

### ðŸ’¡ Key Learning
ATS platforms create systematic extraction challenges. Platform-specific logic yields significant data recovery.

## ðŸ“ˆ deduplicate_threads.py - Conversation Intelligence
**Developed:** June 2025

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Email threads were being counted as separate interview opportunities, creating unrealistic metrics (572 "interviews" vs. actual ~10-15).

### ðŸ”§ Key Improvements
- **Thread detection:** Group related emails by subject similarity and company
- **Conversation consolidation:** Merge multiple emails into single opportunity records
- **Timeline preservation:** Maintain thread history and email count metadata
- **Confidence optimization:** Use highest confidence scores from thread
